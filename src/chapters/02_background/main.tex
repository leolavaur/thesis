\section{Introduction\label{sec:bg.intro}}

This chapter provides the necessary background and preliminaries to understand the rest of the thesis. 
We start by laying out the basics of \gls{ml} for intrusion detection in \Cref{sec:bg.ids}, followed by the implications of scaling up to \glspl{cids} in \Cref{sec:bg.collab}, enumerating along the way the challenges that motivate the use of \gls{fl}.
We then introduce the fundamentals of \gls{fl} in \Cref{sec:bg.fl}, focusing on the FedAvg algorithm and the notations used throughout the thesis.
Finally, we discuss the threats against \gls{fl} in \Cref{sec:bg.fl.threats}, with a particular focus on data poisoning attacks.

\section{Conclusion and takeaways\label{sec:bg.conclusion}}

In this chapter, we have introduced the basics of \gls{ml} for intrusion detection and the challenges of scaling up to \glspl{cids}.
We have also introduced the fundamentals of \gls{fl} its implications.
With the challenges listed along the way, the relationship between \gls{fl} and \gls{cids} becomes straightforward: \gls{fl} is a natural fit for \glspl{cids} as it allows to leverage the benefits of distributed learning while preserving the locality of the data.

In the next chapter, we will review the state of the art in \gls{fl} in the context of \gls{cids}, focusing on the different approaches to the problem and the challenges they face.
Notably, we will discuss \Cref{rq:intro.fids}: \emph{What makes applying \gls{fl} to \glspl{ids} specific?}.
