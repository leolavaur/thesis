\chapter{An Overview of FIDSs' Performance and Limitations\label{chap:app}}

\section{Introduction\label{sec:app.intro}}

In the previous chapters, we have discussed the perspectives offered by applying \gls{fl} to \glspl{ids}, notably in terms of collaboration.
Based on the insights gained from the literature, it is now clear that \gls{fl} can be used to train a global model over the distributed data of a federation of organizations.
It even seems that \gls{fl} could be used to share attack knowledge, still without sharing participants' local data.

In this chapter, we present critical examples showing the challenges that arise when applying \gls{fl} to \glspl{cids}.
We start by laying out in \Cref{sec:app.overview} the practical use case that will be used throughout the rest of the manuscript.
Then, we highlight some limitations of \gls{fl} in the context of \glspl{cids} in \Cref{sec:app.demo}, based on our demonstration paper published at ICDCS 2024~\cite{lavaur_icdcs_demo_2024}.
%In the last sections, we further analyze some of the results, using the insights gained from the work of Akshat Chaudhary, an intern that worked on this project in 2023. -- TODO

\section{Conclusion and Takeways\label{sec:app.conclusion}}

In this chapter, we have presented a practical use case for \gls{fl} in the context of \glspl{cids}.
This use case will be used throughout the rest of the manuscript to illustrate the different contributions and results.
Based on this use case, we have also exposed some limitations of \glspl{fids}, notably in terms of data heterogeneity and susceptibility to poisoning attacks.
We will explore these limitations further in the next chapters: the impact of data heterogeneity in \Cref{chap:topologies}, and the impact of poisoning attacks in \Cref{chap:assessment}.
Finally, we will present some solutions to these limitations in \Cref{chap:radar} and \Cref{chap:future}.
