\section{Introduction\label{sec:bg.intro}}

This chapter provides the necessary background and preliminaries to understand the rest of the thesis. 
We start by laying out the basics of \gls{ml} for intrusion detection in \Cref{sec:bg.ids}, followed by the implications of scaling up to \glspl{cids} in \Cref{sec:bg.collab}, enumerating along the way the challenges that motivate the use of \gls{fl}.
We then introduce the fundamentals of \gls{fl} in \Cref{sec:bg.fl}, focusing on the FedAvg algorithm and the notations used throughout the thesis.
Finally, we discuss the threats against \gls{fl} in \Cref{sec:bg.threats}, with a particular focus on data poisoning attacks.
