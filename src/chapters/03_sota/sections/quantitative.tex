\section{Quantitative Analysis\label{sec:sota.quanti}}

This section provides indicators of the representation of \glspl{fids} in the scientific literature: the evolution of the publications, the relevant venues, the active groups, and the topics of interest.
Notably, the identification of the most active groups and most relevant venues provides insights on how to keep track of the most recent advances in the field.

\subsection{Evolution of the Topic\label{sec:sota.quanti.time}}

The topic of \gls{ids} started to gain traction in the late 1990', as depicted in \Cref{fig:sota.evol-topics}.
After a stagnation period, the topic regained interest around 2015, with an increase of the research on \gls{iot} and \gls{iiot}~\cite{doshi_MachineLearningDDoS_2018,chaabouni_NetworkIntrusionDetection_2019}, alongside other specific use cases.
With the introduction of \gls{fl} by \textcite{mcmahan_Communicationefficientlearningdeep_2017}, the community started to explore the application of \gls{fl} to \gls{ids} around the years 2018--2019.
\Cref{fig:sota.evol-topics} has been generated using the analytics offered by Scopus and the following queries: 
\begin{queries}
  \item \texttt{intrusion AND detection AND system}; \label{qry:ids}
  \item \texttt{federated AND learning}. \label{qry:fl}
\end{queries}

Recent works on \gls{fl} focus on its security and privacy-preserving aspects~\cite{nguyen_PoisoningAttacksFederated_2020b,lyu_ThreatsFederatedLearning_2020,mothukuri_surveysecurityprivacy_2021}.
Techniques like homomorphic encryption were introduced as early as 2017~\cite{hardy_Privatefederatedlearning_2017}, and have been extensively reviewed since.
More recently, other privacy-preserving techniques have been applied to \gls{fl}, such as \gls{mpc} in FLGUARD
\cite{nguyen_FLGUARDSecurePrivate_2021} or differential privacy in \cite{kim_FederatedLearningLocal_2021}.
\Glspl{fids} present a similar tendency with more research towards algorithm security and privacy-preserving techniques.
For instance, \textcite{li_DeepFedFederatedDeep_2020} use homomorphic encryption to provide a secure and privacy-preserving aggregation of models.
Aside from security, variations of \gls{hfl} started to appear in 2021, such as segmented \gls{fl} in
\cite{sun_AdaptiveFederatedLearning_2020}, as standard \gls{hfl} has significantly been studied for \gls{fids}.

Finally, the numerous literature reviews published since 2021~\cite{agrawal_FederatedLearningintrusion_2022,alazab_FederatedLearningCybersecurity_2021,campos_EvaluatingFederatedLearning_2022,lavaur_EvolutionFederatedLearningbased_2022,fedorchenko_ComparativeReviewIntrusion_2022,ghimire_RecentAdvancesFederated_2022,ismaila_ReviewApproachesFederated_2024} show the
continuous interest of the community for the study of \glspl{fids}.
These also show the need for synthesis and structuring of research in this area.


\subsection{Relevant Venues\label{sec:sota.quanti.venues}}

The initial study published in 2022~\cite{lavaur_EvolutionFederatedLearningbased_2022} observed very few recurring venues for the publication of \gls{fids} research.
Indeed, only three venues had more than one publication on the topic: the \emph{IEEE Internet of Things Journal}~\cite{popoola_FederatedDeepLearning_2021,zhang_BlockchainbasedFederatedLearning_2020}, \emph{IEEE
Access}~\cite{chen_IntrusionDetectionWireless_2020,li_DistributedNetworkIntrusion_2020}, and the \emph{IEEE BigData} conference~\cite{cetin_FederatedWirelessNetwork_2019,fan_IoTDefenderFederatedTransfer_2020}.
The original distribution in terms of venue type (11 conferences, 10 journals and 1 book chapter) has significantly changed, since journals represent two thirds of the publications.
It is worth noting that the number of publications in conferences is twice inferior to the number of publications in journals, as depicted in \Cref{fig:sota.venues}.
Multiple reasons can explain this shift, such as a gain in maturity of the field.
However, it is likely that the COVID-19 pandemic partially influenced this trend, as conferences were more impacted by the restrictions than journals.

\begin{figure}

  \input{figures/venues_histogram.pgf}
  \caption{
    Distribution of the publications in the most recurring venues.
    \label{fig:sota.venues}
  }
\end{figure}

Another observation of the initial study was the diversity of the venues, spanning a wide range of topics, from \gls{iot} to \gls{ics}, including transportation systems and extra-terrestrial networks.
This diversity is still present in the most recent publications, although a few generic venues now host significantly more publications: the \emph{IEEE Internet of Things Journal}, \emph{IEEE Access} and \emph{Computers \& Security}.
The latter is the first security-specific venue to appear in the list.
Its place in the top venues is a sign of the increasing interest of the security community for \gls{fl} and \gls{fids}, as most contributions were previously published in more use-case specific venues.
Lastly, while relevant venues have been accepting \gls{fl} literature since its introduction, they start to host specific tracks or special issues, such as ICDCS's track on ``Federated Learning, Analytics, and Deployment'', or IEEE BigData's ``Special Session on Federated Learning on Big Data''.


\subsection{Active Groups\label{sec:sota.quanti.authors}}

Since they introduced the topic of \gls{fl} in 2016, the team at Google Research has been a big influence for the research community \cite{konecny_FederatedLearningStrategies_2016,konecny_FederatedOptimizationDistributed_2016,mcmahan_Communicationefficientlearningdeep_2017,bonawitz_PracticalSecureAggregation_2017,bonawitz_FederatedLearningScale_2019}.
They mostly work on the primitives behind \gls{fl}, such as model aggregation with the \texttt{FedAvg} algorithm~\cite{mcmahan_Communicationefficientlearningdeep_2017}.
The team of TU Darmstadt (Germany) has also been very active in the field, with a focus on \gls{ids} with \texttt{D√èoT}~\cite{marchal_AuDIAutonomousIoT_2019,nguyen_DIoTFederatedSelflearning_2019} and \gls{fl} security~\cite{nguyen_PoisoningAttacksFederated_2020b}.
The two collaborated, bringing \texttt{FLGUARD}~\cite{nguyen_FLGUARDSecurePrivate_2021} and \texttt{FLAME}~\cite{nguyen_FLAMETamingBackdoors_2022}, two algorithms focusing on limiting the impact of poisoning attacks in \gls{fl}.
These series of works makes them one of the most impactful groups in the field.

Other noteworthy groups include the Aalto University (Finland)~\cite{nguyen_FLGUARDSecurePrivate_2021} and the University of Tokyo (Japan)~\cite{sun_AdaptiveFederatedLearning_2020,sun_AdaptiveIntrusionDetection_2021,qin_FederatedLearningBasedNetwork_2021}.
The most active country remains China, with a dozen institutions now amounting to a third of the publications in the field, as illustrated by \Cref{fig:sota.countries,fig:sota.affiliations}.


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/affiliations_histogram.pgf}
  \caption{
    Distribution of the publications by affiliation.
    \label{fig:sota.affiliations}
  }
\end{figure}

Investigating the major authors tells another story, as the most active authors are not necessarily affiliated with the groups mentioned above.
In particular, \Citeauthor{popoola_FederatedDeepLearning_2021} co-authored several publications on \gls{fids}~\cite{popoola_FederatedDeepLearning_2021,popoola_FederatedDeepLearning_2021a,popoola_OptimizingDeepLearning_2022,popoola_FederatedDeepLearning_2023} as a collaboration between the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications and multiple British universities.
Likewise, \Citeauthor{duy_Federatedlearningbasedintrusion_2021}, from the University of Information Technology (VNU, Vietnam), are also quite represented in terms of publications~\cite{duy_Federatedlearningbasedintrusion_2021,vy_FederatedLearningBasedIntrusion_2021,thi_FederatedLearningBasedCyber_2022,quyen_FederatedIntrusionDetection_2022}.

\subsection{Topics of Interest\label{sec:sota.quanti.topics}}

Using topic modeling, we extract the main topics of interest from the 153 publications on \glspl{fids} identified in the updated selection.
By construction, the model is unable to differentiate between application domains (such as \gls{iot} or \gls{ics}) the techniques used (\eg, blockchains) or the addressed challenges in a paper.
However, it provides a good overview of the main topics of interest in the field, especially for the consequent amount of literature published since the initial study.
\Cref{fig:sota.topics} present the topics identified by the model, with the most recurring keywords for each topic.


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/topic_clouds.pdf}
  \caption{
    Topics of interest in the field of \glspl{fids}.
    \label{fig:sota.topics}
  }
\end{figure}

First, this analysis highlights the application domains of \glspl{fids}, where the topic of \gls{iot} (\ie, \texttt{internet\_things}, \texttt{edge}, \texttt{things}) is one of the most recurring (Topics 4, 9, and 10).
Other applications stand out, such as \gls{ics} (\texttt{industrial}, \texttt{iiot}), \gls{iomt} (\texttt{medical}, \texttt{healthcare}), \gls{v2x} (\texttt{vehicle}, \texttt{vehicular}, \texttt{transportation}), and \gls{sdn} (\texttt{software}, \texttt{defined}, \texttt{sdn}).
These applications also correlate with the venues identified in \Cref{sec:sota.quanti.venues}, as the \emph{IEEE Internet of Things Journal} or the \emph{IEEE Trans. on Industrial Informatics} do focus on \gls{iot} and \gls{ics}, respectively.
\Cref{fig:sota.domains} depicts the distribution of the publications by domain overall.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}{0.48\textwidth}
    \centering
    \input{figures/domain_pie.pgf}
    \caption{
      Distribution of the publications by domain.

  \end{subfigure}
  \hfill
  \begin{subfigure}{0.48\textwidth}

    }
  \end{subfigure}
  
  \caption{
    Exploiting the topics of interest.
    \label{fig:sota.challenges-domains}
  }
\end{figure}

Likewise, some topics are directly associated with the challenges identified in \Cref{sec:sota.discuss.open}.
For instance, Topic 0 (\texttt{poisoning}, \texttt{defense}, \texttt{malicious}) represents works focusing on adversarial attacks against \glspl{fids} and their mitigation. 
Some techniques can also be extracted from these results.
For instance, Topic 0 also contains \texttt{similarity} as a keyword, which is likely to refer to the use of similarity metrics to detect poisoning attacks.
This is indeed one of the most represented mitigation techniques in the literature on \gls{fids}~\cite{yang_Dependablefederatedlearning_2023} or \gls{fl} alike~\cite{fung_LimitationsFederatedLearning_2020,nguyen_FLAMETamingBackdoors_2022}.
\Cref{fig:sota.challenges} depicts the distribution of the addressed challenges over time.
Unlike the distribution of the publications by domain, some challenges are addressed in the literature much later, such as handling the heterogeneity of the data (\Cref{chal:heterogeneity}) or resisting to adversarial attacks (\Cref{chal:adversarial}).
Both are challenges that have been identified in the initial study as open issues in the field~\cite{lavaur_EvolutionFederatedLearningbased_2022,lavaur_Federatedlearningenabler_2022}.
