\section{Methodology\label{sec:sota.methodo}}

This section details the methodology applied to review the state of the art of \glspl{fids}.
The original article follows the \gls{slr} methodology introduced to the engineering field by \textcite{kitchenham_Guidelinesperformingsystematic_2007}.
\Gls{slr} uses analytical methods to answer research questions about the literature on a specific topic.
The update to the original article is less structured and more focused on the evolution of the field, so the methodology is adapted accordingly.
