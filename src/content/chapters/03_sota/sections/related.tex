\section{Related Work\label{sec:sota.related}}

Literature related to \gls{fl} for \gls{ids} can be divided into three main categories: 
\begin{enumerate*}[(a)]
  \item security information sharing,
  \item intrusion detection, and
  \item federated learning.
\end{enumerate*}




When the data collection for this study was completed in late 2021, the literature on \gls{fl} for \gls{ids} was rather scarce.
Only a handful of reviews had been published on the topic~\cite{alazab_FederatedLearningCybersecurity_2021,agrawal_FederatedLearningIntrusion_2021,campos_EvaluatingFederatedLearning_2021}.
In addition, we extended our search to include works on security-related information sharing~\cite{skopik_problemsharedproblem_2016,tounsi_surveytechnicalthreat_2018,wagner_Cyberthreatintelligence_2019,pala_InformationSharingCybersecurity_2019}, 


A consequent amount of literature exists on the topic of collaboration and intrusion detection~\cite{zhou_surveycoordinatedattacks_2010,vasilomanolakis_TrustAwareCollaborativeIntrusion_2017}, including the use of \gls{ml}~\cite{buczak_SurveyDataMining_2016,meng_WhenIntrusionDetection_2018,chaabouni_NetworkIntrusionDetection_2019,dacosta_InternetThingssurvey_2019} and security knowledge sharing~\cite{}.
As \gls{fl} was a rather novel concept at the time, 
Finally, the end of 2021 (when data collection for this initial study stopped) also saw the publication of a handful of reviews on \gls{fl} for \gls{ids} specifically.

\Cref{tbl:sota.related} provides a summary of this selection, grouped by topic and sorted by publication date.
